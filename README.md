Yelp for campsites web application built as final project for a course

## What is YelpCamp?

It is simply Yelp for campsites. Finding a new campsite that you'll love is difficult and you don't want to pick the wrong one and literally be stuck. YelpCamp allows users to find camps other users loved and read about them. 

Users can also post campsites they loved to help others.

## How was it built?

YelpCamp was built using Node.js with Express and MongoDB as a database.
